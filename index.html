            1v1 Teambuilder

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">1v1, or pretty much any OM has a vastly different (I hope) playstyle compared to your standard tiers. 1v1 has a special quality to it as it's unlike any other OM. (bar 2v2) That means it should have a totally different approach to teambuilding. 
        </p>
        <p>That's why I have created 1v1 teambuilder, a personlized teambuilder just for the 1v1 metagame that can design 1 team at a time. Think of it as a programming IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for 1v1 players!</p>
        
        <ul><b>What This Application Includes:</b>
            <li>A section where all standard 1v1 sets reside (much cleaner than the Pokepaste)
            </li>
            <li>
            A way to track your team's progression through the teambuilding process from start to finish
            </li>
            <li>
            An integrated Threat Checklist that you can check off when you feel that you can eliminate the threat with a specific pokemon or more.           
            </li>
            <li>
            New classifications or sortings of pokemon that are user friendly which guide you when teambuilding.
            </li>
            <li>
            Speed Tiers make sense in this version.
            </li>
            <li>
            A sleek design that makes building a team an enjoyable experience.
            </li>
            <li>You can use it as a web application or download it!
            </li>
